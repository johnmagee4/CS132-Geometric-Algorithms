CS132
=====

These are lecture notes for Computer Science 132, _Geometric
Algorithms,_ which I am teaching at Boston University during Summer 2015.

This course is based on _Linear Algebra and its Applications,_ by David
C. Lay, Addison-Wesley (Pearson), 4th edition and 5th edition.

These files were primarily created by Prof. Mark Crovella. 
The initial state of this repository contains copies of the lecture notes from Prof. Crovella. During
the course of the summer term, notes will be updated as we move through them.

The notes are in the form of ipython notebooks.   Demos and most figures
are included as executable Python code.   Currently all code is in Python 2.7.

Each notebook can be presented as a slideshow using the very nice
package "Live Reveal", https://github.com/damianavila/RISE, by
@damianavila.  This is how I give the lectures, sometimes modifying the
code during the lecture to illustrate points or explore ideas that come up.

Lecture notes are also available in pdf, as converted using nbconvert.
